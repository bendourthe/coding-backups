- Fixed bug: When doing point intersection, the main panel is appropriatly resized so you can see the status strip.

Version 1.4.13
- New: Added list of recent files.

Version 1.4.12
- New: Can now delete nodes from the Scenegraph viewer. The Scenegraph viewer also updates its slected node as new nodes are selected in the main window.
- Update: Pronation/Supination angle is now set relative to neutral.

Version 1.4.11

Version 1.4.10
- New: Added ability to view and edit the parameters for the main Othrographic Camera in the scene.

Version 1.4.9
- Fixed bug: Fixed problem with the neutral position getting the capitate offset even when the reference bone was the mc3
- New: Added text display for global wrist position in Full Wrist mode

Version 1.4.8
- Fixed bug: Fixed problem when hiding Inertial axes if there were problems showing them. Prevent null reference exception.
- New: Added ability to show inertial axes for the metacarpals as well as the carpal bones. 
- New: Added ability to show wrist position by a bone other then the capitate. (currently only the mc3)

Version 1.4.7
- New: Can change the render style for selected objects. Either bounding box or tight fiting lines.

Version 1.4.6
- Fixed bug: Can load linked iv files in full wrist mode.
- New: Some really basic head tracking using a wiimote and led head bar. Very experimental, but a kind of fun toy.

Version 1.4.5
- Fixed bug: Inertial axes are now hidden with the bones.  Bug must have been introducted when I switched over to using ColoredBone type for displaying colors with Distv mode.

Version 1.4.4
- New: Can show all of the wrist positions on a plot of FE & RU. Also, clicking on the point will take you to that position.

Version 1.4.3
- New: Can set the color of the distance map contours. Currently it is only one color, but this should be fixed in later versions.
- New: Can supply a config file that can rename the series names into something more human friendly
- Fixed bug: Added basic error handling when files are open from the command line or using drag & drop.

Version 1.4.2
 - New: Can edit transforms in texture, and copy those values to the clipboard, for entry into a WristRegistration config file. 
 - New: Can hide bones in texture. Not as pretty as it should be, but it works.

Version 1.4.1
- Fixed bug: Fixed problem with installer. Did not install coin3d dll files, so the program would not run.

Version 1.4.0
- Fixed bug: Texture no longer allows adjusting registration by default, to avoid the problem with loosing focus for key presses. 
- New: Can choose to animate between positions, using very basic linear interpolation. "eye candy"
- New: Can load distance fields if they exist, and generate distance maps for bones as well as contour information.
- New: Can vizually edit the final optimized both transform that is output from the Wrist Registration Program

Version 1.3.5
- Fixed bug: Texture planes are now located in the center of each voxel
- New: Texture allows you to step through each bone's registration in the auto_registr txt file from the registration code. There is a known bug with window focus and the arrow keys. They can get stuck on the registration window and stop controlling the texture slices.
- Changed over to the latest release of Coin (2.5.0), Hopefully this will fix some strange rendering problems without creating new ones :)

Version 1.3.4
- Fixed bug: No longer crashes when trying to load texture (texture does't have a controller, so but was introduced in version 1.3.0)
- Fixed bug: No longer crashes in texture when reading a classified scan
- Fixed bug: Vertical plane loads correctly in texture for all images
- Fixed bug: In MRIViewer, cleared auto-scale text box when not over a pixel

Version 1.3.3
- Fixed bug: in distv mode, would crash after the the relative bone was changed into non-radius for the second time (ie. radius-> non-radius -> radius -> non-radius).

Version 1.3.2
- Feature: Distv has been ported, now runs.
- Fixed bug: In fullwrist mode, hitting hide-all or show-all would check bones that were disabled.

Version 1.3.1
- Fixed bug: MRIViewer can crash when trying to read pixels on bottom edge. Also, added additional text outputs for mouseover events.

Version 1.3.0
- Major re-write of main class, to move lots of ugly code into their own controller classes. There SHOULD be no major change to the end user.
- Fixed bug: Removed warning when loading filename that starts with a number
- Fixed bug: Corrected pixel identification in MRIViewer

Version 1.2.3
- Fixed bug. When loading new scene, force background to black.
- Fixed bug. Removed warning when loading filename with space in it.
- New Feature: MRIViewer. Pretty cool I say.

Version 1.2.2
- Fixed bug, so that when showing the scenegraph it tries to find the separator directly above, not starting with the second node

Version 1.2.1
- When loading an IV file, the filename is saved for the node name
- When viewing scenegraph, it will try and highlight the separator for the currently selected node, instead of defaulting to the root node

Version 1.2.0
- New: Added Texture functionality. Ability to load the stack file (based on the original neutral scan) onto the CT image from various sources.
