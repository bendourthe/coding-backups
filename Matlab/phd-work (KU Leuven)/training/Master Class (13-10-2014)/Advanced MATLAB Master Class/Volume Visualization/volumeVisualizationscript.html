         <h2>Introduction<a name="1"></a></h2>
         <p>Now I'd like to show you one application of the technology we've discussed today.  We'd like to build a simple GUI to aid
            with the visualization of 3D data sets.  Let's take a look:
         </p>
         <p>We start with some sample data that ships with MATLAB. Fluid flow speed (<tt>v</tt>) has been measured over a fully-populated 3-D grid of a prismatic space <tt>x, y,</tt> and <tt>z</tt>.  We would like to be able to visualize the measurements <tt>v</tt>.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">[x,y,z,v] = flow;
volvisGUI(x,y,z,v)
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="volumeVisualizationscript_01.png"> <pre class="codeinput">close <span class="string">all</span>;
</pre><p>We'll break down this work into two parts.  The first thing we do is to develop the functionality that builds the background
            of the visualization and allows us to add and remove slice planes.
         </p>
         <p>We'll look at the use of function handles and nested functions to develop a custom data visualization routine that encapsulates
            data and funtionality (methods).
         </p>
         <p>In this example, you will see how to use function handles to export nested functions.  Since nested functions can have persistent
            data, this gives a very nice way to store data along with functionality. You could consider this as an object-oriented-like
            approach to building custom functionality in MATLAB, as an alternative to traditional functional programming. You will also
            see how to use function handles and nested functions for GUI callbacks.
         </p>
         <h2>Create initial visualization<a name="6"></a></h2>
         <p>We can use the custom function we developed (<tt>volumeVisualization</tt>) to draw the bottom and back walls of the measurement space.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">fh = volumeVisualization(x,y,z,v);
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="volumeVisualizationscript_02.png"> <h2>Setup<a name="7"></a></h2>
         <p>Edit <tt>volumeVisualization</tt>. Setup the desktop so <tt>volumeVisualization</tt> and command window are visible.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">edit <span class="string">volumeVisualizationPseudo</span>
</pre><p>Let's take a quick look at the code. We first initialize handles to the axis where we are drawing, and to a slice plane, which
            we'll see in a minute.  Since these handles are initialized here (in the main function), they will be accessible inside of
            all nested functions. We then create data for a generic slice through the yz-plane.  This is a grid of coordinates just like
            you see on the back right wall (with the blue circle).  We'll move this plane back and forth along the x-axis to visualize
            the flow field.  Again, this data will be accessible inside of all  of the nested functions.  Finally, we call <tt>initDisplay</tt>, which is a nested function that generates the initial display. [Show <tt>initDisplay</tt>].  After the nested functions, the last thing we do is create an output structure.
         </p>
         <p>The function returns <tt>fh</tt>, which you can think of as a handle to the visualization.  Let's take a look at it:
         </p><pre class="codeinput">fh
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
fh = 

           addSlicePlane: @volumeVisualization/addSlicePlane
    deleteLastSlicePlane: @volumeVisualization/deleteLastSlicePlane
                    xMin: 0.1000
                    xMax: 9.9000

</pre><p>Notice that we've done something different here.  Instead of returning what you might expect - handles to the 3 surfaces that
            were drawn, perhaps - we've actually returned a structure.  The last two fields of the structure are self-explanatory - they
            just capture the minimum and maximum values of the x-coordinates. Can anyone figure out what's going with the first two fields?
         </p>
         <p>[Scroll in the editor so that <tt>addSlicePlane</tt> and <tt>deleteSlicePlane</tt> are visible.]
         </p>
         <p>The first two fields contain handles to nested functions inside of volvis.</p>

% We'll look at the use of function handles and nested

% You could consider this as an object-oriented-like approach to building

%% Create initial visualization
% We can use the custom function we developed (|volumeVisualization|) to draw the
% bottom and back walls of the measurement space.
fh = volumeVisualization(x,y,z,v);


%% Setup
% Edit |volumeVisualization|. Setup the desktop so |volumeVisualization|
% and command window are visible.
edit volumeVisualizationPseudo

% Let's take a quick look at the code. We first initialize handles to
% the axis where we are drawing, and to a slice plane, which we'll see

%
% [Scroll in the editor so that |addSlicePlane| and |deleteSlicePlane|
% are visible.]
%
% The first two fields contain handles to nested functions inside of
% volvis.

%% Draw a slice plane
% We can draw a slice plane at x=9 to get a feel for the data 
fh.addSlicePlane(9)

%% Draw more slice planes
% That was so useful, let's draw more
fh.addSlicePlane(7)
fh.addSlicePlane(5)
fh.addSlicePlane(3)

%% Put them away
% When we don't want a slice plane any longer, we can delete it. LIFO
fh.deleteLastSlicePlane();
fh.deleteLastSlicePlane();
fh.deleteLastSlicePlane();

%% How does this work?
% Let's take a closer look at the code so that we can figure out what is
% going on.  What is happening when we type |fh.addSlicePlane(9)|?
% Since this field contains a handle to the function
% |addSlicePlane|, we are actually calling the function |addSlicePlane|.
% [Show source for |addSlicePlace|].  |addSlicePlane| adds a slice plane
% at the specified x-coordinate.  The first line sets the x-coordinate
% of our slice plane.  While it uses the value of |xLoc| we passed in,
% it's using the value of |yd| that was created at the top of the main
% function.  The next line draws the slice plane.  The one after that
% stores a handle to the slice plane we just drew.  Note that this is
% building a stack of handles to every slice plane.  The final step just
% makes the slice plane look nice.
%
% |deleteSlicePlane| is a bit simpler - it just deletes the newest slice
